# Scorekeeper-Game
This is an easy Score-Keeper game which I created while I was learning Javascript. Learned how to work with CSS framework.
Instructions:
1. You have to select an option from the select/dropdown menu.
2. Then click on the respective player's button to score.
3. Player reaching the target score first wins. 
4. Click on the reset button to start again.
